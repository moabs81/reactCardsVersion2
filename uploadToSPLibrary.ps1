# Title: Upload To SharePoint Library
# Author: Nick Hendricks
# Version: 0.1.0
# Directions For Use: 
#  (1) update the $uri parameter to match the SharePoint library to which you wish to upload files
#  (2) use the npm script 'npm run spUpload' to upload any bundled resources found in the './spApp' directory
# Notes Regarding Use:
#  This script will only work in the following conditions: 
#    (1) It is located in the base directory of the project
#    (2) The application is being built into the './spApp' directory
#    (3) The URI is properly input prior to running the script
# Someday I'll make this much nicer, to include
#  (1) initial inputs (with defaults) for the library URI and the project spApp directory (if altered)
#  (2) graceful handling of error conditions for improper paths or no files
# Happy Dev'ing!
