### Context
This simple application is being used as a pilot testbed for creating a development workflow for a SharePoint on-premise deployment.

### Technologies Used In This Project
The technologies used to build this project are Node based and are listed in [this readme](https://github.com/moabs81/scaffold2/blob/master/readme.md). The client side Javascript library is [React](https://reactjs.org/).
