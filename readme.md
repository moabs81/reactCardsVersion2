## React Card Concept

If this UI concept were a cable package, the cable company would always be asking me to upgrade it. Cuz it's basic. 

Things needed:
* write .ps1 to promote and harden that part of the process
* figure out workflow for transforming dev's 'app.js' to prod's 'spApp.js'
    * dev REST endpoints vs. prod REST endpoints
        * make dev match prod past the base

### Context
This simple application is being used as a pilot testbed for creating a development workflow for a SharePoint on-premise deployment. It makes use of my [scaffold](https://github.com/moabs81/scaffold2) and contains some additions to the workflow and build process that will included in a future SharePoint focused development scaffold. 

### Technologies Used In This Project
The technologies used to build this project are Node based and are listed in [this readme](https://github.com/moabs81/scaffold2/blob/master/readme.md). The client side Javascript library is [React](https://reactjs.org/).
